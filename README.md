ExpenseSplitter
===============

Have you ever been on trip with friends and at the end a hair-pulling situation of managing expenses ? Did you have problems splitting bills with your room-mate ? Then, this app is for you.

When you go out with your friends or colleagues we share our expenses with each other. Typically, some bills are paid by ABC and some bills by XYZ. The splitting of expenses after the trip is a headache. How much has XYZ to contribute ? How much he already paid ? How much someone else have to pay him back ? And the same set of questions follow for everyoen in the group.

So as a solution expense splitter will record and manage group expenses. This app also allows multiple currencies in case there are friends from different countries.
